  // ---------------------
  // Implement this function that takes a css selector as its only argument.
  // It should obtain articles from this endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/api/articles` (test it in Postman/HTTPie!).
  // However, the articles do not come organized in a single, neat array. Inspect the response closely!
  // Create a card from each and every article object in the response, using the Card component.
  // Append each card to the element in the DOM that matches the selector passed to the function.
  //
